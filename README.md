# String Calculator TDD Kata

## Overview

This project is a solution to the String Calculator TDD Kata. The goal is to develop a simple string calculator using Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. The calculator takes a string of numbers separated by delimiters and returns their sum. This project demonstrates the use of TDD by writing tests first, then implementing code to pass those tests, and finally refactoring for improvement.

## Features

- Handles an empty string and returns 0.
- Handles a single number and returns that number.
- Handles two numbers separated by a comma and returns their sum.
- Handles an unknown amount of numbers.
- Supports new lines as delimiters between numbers.
- Supports custom delimiters specified in the input string.
- Throws an exception for negative numbers, listing all negative numbers in the message.
